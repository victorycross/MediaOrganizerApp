# GitHub Setup Instructions

This guide will help you push the Media Organizer project to GitHub and set up the repository properly.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `MediaOrganizerApp` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Professional macOS media file organizer built with SwiftUI`
   - Visibility: Public or Private (your choice)
   - **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd MediaOrganizerApp-GitHub

# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MediaOrganizerApp.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

#### GitHub Pages (Optional)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `main` / `docs` (if you want to host documentation)

#### Repository Topics
Add these topics to help others discover your project:
- `macos`
- `swiftui`
- `media-organizer`
- `file-management`
- `swift`
- `xcode`
- `app-sandbox`
